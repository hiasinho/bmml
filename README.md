# BMML - Business Model Markup Language

A YAML-based markup format for describing business models, based on Alexander Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas frameworks.

## What is BMML?

BMML (`.bmml` files) provides a structured, machine-readable way to capture business models. It's designed to be:

- **AI-analyzable** - Structured for machine parsing and analysis
- **Version-controllable** - Git-friendly with meaningful diffs
- **Validatable** - Schema-enforced consistency and relationship checking
- **Human-readable** - Familiar YAML syntax for technical users

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
```
